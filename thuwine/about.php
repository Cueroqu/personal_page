    <p style="margin-left: 20%; margin-right: 20%; text-align:center; font-size:13px; font-family: Georgia; text-align:justify;">The Tsinghua University Wine Association is China’s leading student wine society. Founded in 2012, it has quickly become the country’s most prestigious platform for estates to present their wines at China’s best university. Made up of 100 members, the society organises weekly tastings, and bi-annual dinners that showcase the finest wines from around the world. In its first two years of existence, the society counted producers such as Châteaux Margaux, Cos d’Estournel, Tenuta di Trinoro and Spring Mountain among its guests. Given its position in Beijing, and the growing interest in fine wine in China, TUWA aims to ignite a passion for the subject among future generations of Chinese leaders.
